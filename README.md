# In this homework we are testing our brand new learned skill - node js- 

I am going to make an app that can take in one of the following commands, and answer back to the user with some cool info .
(my version of Siri, but this is  console Liri)

my-tweets
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says

By calling APIs from twitter , Spotify and OMDB. 
I have to be able to pull some very cool info from a new twitter account , and see at least 20 of the latest tweets.

#twitter:
    20 tweets
    
#Spotify :
   Artist(s)
   The song's name
   A preview link of the song from Spotify
   The album that the song is from

#OMDB :
   Title of the movie.
   Year the movie came out.
   IMDB Rating of the movie.
   Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
   Country where the movie was produced.
   Language of the movie.
   Plot of the movie.
   Actors in the movie.
   
   I need to create different javascript files, install some npms as well , add some gitignore .
  In here I tried to add as much details of the app as possible but in case I miss any fill free to check it out and enjoy the app.
